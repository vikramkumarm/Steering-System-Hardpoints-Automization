Steering Hardpoints Optimization Tool
📌 Overview

This project provides a Python-based automation template to calculate and optimize steering system hardpoints (A, B, C, D, E) based on steering kinematics and geometric constraints.
It helps replace manual graphical methods with an analytical and repeatable approach.
