# Steering Hardpoints Optimization Tool

## OBJECTIVE
This project provides a **Python-based automation template** to calculate and optimize **steering system hardpoints (A, B, C, D, E)** using analytical steering kinematics and numerical optimization.  
It replaces manual graphical methods with a repeatable and parametric computational approach.
